## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious and creative Computer Science student from IGDTUW, passionate about building meaningful software projects that address real-world challenges. From C++ tools to web-based environmental companions, I thrive in collaborative as well as solo development.

I believe in hands-on learning, clean UI, and solving problems with a spark of innovation.
